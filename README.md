# Index-based-Search-Enabler-REST-API-
A simple Backend approach of generating a REST API that facilitates an easy and efficient search enabler using Indexes (can be Created as well as Deleted in the API), which is demonstrated using a Sample Movie DB

--STEPS TO BEGIN--
1. You can use this Project by simply installing the needed Packages (at your terminal), kindly refer the "package.json" file and install the required by cross checking the "dependencies" (NOTE make sure all these files/Folders are inside a single Folder and then install the packages while inside that single Folder).
2. At the .env file, we can change PORT (to your desire number) as well as add your own MongoDB URI so as to establish a connection to your Data base (NOTE: like right before the '?' in your URI you can add your Database name ,Existing or not as the Project already has a Schema (which you can change) which will handle the needed changes but you can add your DB's name if you want to merge the forthcoming Documents).
3. Based on the "Routes.js" there are various routes to handle corresponding requests (and the corresponding responses is at "Controllers->Controller.js").
4. To run the Program type "npm run api" in the terminal (can be altered at "package,json" file at "scripts").
5. Recommend to test the API using Postman or Thunder Client (Extensions also exist in Visual Studio).
